\problemname{All Your Base Are Belong to Palindromes}

Most of the time, humans have 10 fingers. This fact is the main reason that our
numbering system is base-10: the number 257 really means $2 \times 10^2 + 5 \times 10^1 + 7
\times 10^0$. Notice that each digit in base-10 is in the range from $0,\ldots,9$.

Of course, there are other bases we can use: binary (base-2), octal (base-8)
and hexadecimal (base-16) are common bases that really cool people use when
trying to impress others. In base-$b$, the digits are in the range from $0,\ldots,b-1$,
with each digit (when read from right to left) being the multiplier of next
larger power of $b$.

So, for example 9 (in base-10) is:
\begin{itemize}
\item 9 in base-16
\item 11 in base-8 ($1 \times 8^1 + 1 \times 8^0 = 9$)
\item 1001 in base-2 ($1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 9$)
\end{itemize}

Noticing the above, you can see that 9 is a palindrome in these 3 different
bases. A palindrome is a sequence which is the same even if it is written in
reverse order: English words such as dad, mom and racecar are palindromes, and
numbers like 9, 11, 1001 are also palindromes.

Given a particular number $X$ (in base-10), what bases $b$ ($2 \leq b < X$) cause the
representation of $X$ in base-$b$ to be a palindrome?

\section*{Input}

There will be one line, containing the integer $X$ ($2 \leq X \leq 1\,000\,000\,000\,000$).

\section*{Output}

The output should consist of a sequence of increasing integers, each on its own
line, indicating which bases have the property that $X$ written in that base is a
palindrome. Note that we will only concern ourselves with bases which are less
than $X$, and that the first possible valid base is 2.
