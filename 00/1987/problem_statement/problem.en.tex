\problemname{From 1987 to 2013}

You might be surprised to know that 2013 is the first year since 1987 with
distinct digits. The years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 each have
distinct digits. 2012 does not have distinct digits, since the digit 2 is
repeated.

Given a year, what is the next year with distinct digits?

\section*{Input}
The input starts with integer $N$, $1\leq N\leq 100\,000$ denoting the number of years in the input.
The next $N$ lines contain an integer $Y$ ($0\leq Y\leq 10^8$), representing the starting year.

\section*{Output}
For each year $Y$ in the input print a line with integer $D$, which is the next
year after $Y$ with distinct digits.
