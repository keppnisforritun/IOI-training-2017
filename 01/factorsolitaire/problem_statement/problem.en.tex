\problemname{Factor Solitaire}
In the game of Factor Solitaire, you start with the number $1$, and try to change it to some given target number $n$ by repeatedly using the following operation. In each step, if $c$ is your current number, you split it into two positive factors $a$, $b$ of your choice such that $c = a \cdot b$. You then add $a$ to your current number $c$ to get your new current number. Doing this costs you $b$ points. You continue doing this until your current number is $n$, and you try to achieve this at the cost of a minimum total number of points.

For example, here is one way to get to $15$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item start with $1$
    \item change $1$ to $1+1=2-\mathrm{cost}$ so far is $1$
    \item change $2$ to $2+1=3-\mathrm{cost}$ so far is $1+2$
    \item change $3$ to $3+3=6-\mathrm{cost}$ so far is $1+2+1$
    \item change $6$ to $6+6=12-\mathrm{cost}$ so far is $1+2+1+1$
    \item change $12$ to $12+3=15-\mathrm{cost}$ so far is $1+2+1+1+4=9$.
\end{itemize}
In fact, this is the minimum possible total cost to get $15$. You want to compute the minimum total cost for other target end numbers.

\section*{Input}
The input consists of a single integer $1\leq N \leq 5\,000\,000$.

\section*{Output}
Compute the minimum cost that gets you to $N$.
